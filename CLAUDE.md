# CLAUDE.md - Development Guidelines for voiceobs

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All code changes MUST follow TDD:

1. **Write tests first** - Before implementing, write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. **Run tests to see them fail** - Verify tests fail for the right reason
3. **Implement minimum code** - Write just enough code to make tests pass
4. **Refactor** - Clean up while keeping tests green

## After Completing Any Task

Always run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Lint and auto-fix issues
uv run ruff check src/voiceobs/ --fix
uv run ruff check tests/ --fix

# 2. Run all unit tests (must pass)
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Check coverage for new code (must be >95%)
uv run python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/voiceobs --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch
```

## Coverage Requirements

New code changes MUST have:
- **Line coverage: >95%**
- **Branch coverage: >95%**

To check coverage for a specific module:
```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/voiceobs/<module>.py --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch
```

## Code Style

- Type hints required for all public functions
- Docstrings required for all public classes and functions
- Use `unittest.mock.patch` for mocking dependencies

<usage>
When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

How to use skills (loaded into main context):
- Use the <path> from the skill entry below
- Invoke: Bash("cat <path>")
- The skill content will load into your current context
- Example: Bash("cat .openskills/backend-architect/SKILL.md")

Usage notes:
- Skills share your context window
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded in your context
</usage>

</skill>

<skill activation="lazy">
<name>skill-systematic-debugging</name>
<description>Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes - four-phase framework (root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation) that ensures understanding before attempting solutions</description>

</skill>

<skill activation="lazy">
<name>skill-requesting-code-review</name>
<description>Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements - dispatches code-reviewer subagent to review implementation against plan or requirements before proceeding</description>

</skill>

<skill activation="lazy">
<name>skill-receiving-code-review</name>
<description>Use when receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable - requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation</description>

</skill>

<skill activation="lazy">
<name>skill-verification-before-completion</name>
<description>Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always</description>
